      <h3>Opulence Abundance is a queer intersex facilitator, artist, and healing professional.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>

      I help individuals and groups navigate conflict in new ways so they can break patterns, harness their power, and change the world. In my spare time, I enjoy making art, hanging out with friends, eating good food, and cuddling with my cat.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p><br>
      As a visible non-binary person of color growing up in conservative South Carolina in the late 1990s & early 2000s, I learned at a young age how to diffuse conflict and communicate across difference. Luckily, I turned out to not only be a gifted, natural diplomat, but I also discovered my love and passion for facilitation.<br>
      <br>
      As a facilitator, I realized that I had the power to shape discussion, allowing myself and others to transcend surface-level discussion and engage in meaningful conversation. As my skill set expanded I came to appreciate how active facilitation can support groups in resolving difficult issues, allow different perspectives to be heard, and even spur groups to take action after weeks of stagnation caused by a paralyzing lack of clarity or disagreement. 
      <br><br>
      Opportunities that allowed me to develop as a facilitator included:
      
      <br>✥ Serving as a diversity advocate and leading discussions with faculty and students at the College of Charleston, SC.
      <br>✥ Providing intersex education and LGBTQIA+ competency workshops to doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina.
      <br>✥ Sharing the stage with Laverne Cox to celebrate LGBTQ+ Resilience. Laverne Cox went on to quote me in her GLAAD acceptance speech.
      <br>✥ Collaborating with different community members to organize actions and speak out against oppressive political conditions.
      <br>✥ Working with movement elders and feminist scholars who modeled different forms of leadership and facilitation styles.
      <br><br>
      In 2014, I made the choice to leave my beloved community in the South and move to Los Angeles, where I began working toward my Master’s in Social Work. During the master’s program I completed two internships, one with Green Dot Charter at Locke High School and one with Lawndale School District. During my work with Green Dot Charter School, I was able to witness the school shifting from a traditional disciplinary system to a Restorative Justice model. At Lawndale School District I was able to collaborate with the school administration to create holistic models of school-based health care and nutrition education.
      <br><br>
      I completed my master’s in 2016, going on to work closely with people experiencing severe and persistent mental illness. I designed group curricula and facilitated group therapy sessions with a variety of populations, including: 
      <br>✥ Youth living in group homes
      <br>✥ Families impacted by the foster care system
      <br>✥ Individuals experiencing persistent psychosis
      <br>✥ Mothers experiencing postpartum depression  
      <br><br>

      In 2018, I transitioned into the role of Associate Director of Grants and Programs at a federally qualified health center in Los Angeles, CA. In this role I: <br>
      <br>✥ Managed over 10 million dollars in grant funds
      <br>✥ Facilitated external partnerships with legal organizations and other supplementary resources
      <br>✥ Developed and managed the Transgender Health Program
      <br>✥ Led site visits and was the main source of contact with grantors
      <br>✥ Established and developed health programs for people exiting incarceration
      <br>✥ Collaborated with the Los Angeles Department of Public Health to create pathways for people exiting incarceration to access healthcare
      <br>✥ Trained other health centers in how to provide care to people exiting incarceration
      <br><br>
      In 2020, I left my role at the health center and began working as a full-time consultant and educator. Simultaneously, I participated in community accountability processes and learned about transformative justice. In 2021, I took the formal role of conflict mediator and have been supporting couples, communities, and organizations in resolving conflict ever since.
      <br><br>
      I now understand my purpose. I see myself as a cycle-breaker who helps people break patterns, live new stories, and step into their power. I offer conflict mediation, accountability coaching, communication workshops, and motivational speaking in service of this mission.
      <br> <br>
      I have found that sharing my own story of being a chronically high-conflict individual to be especially powerful in transforming workplace culture, easing tensions, and seeding compassion in high stress spaces.
